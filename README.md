# noLogarithms

## A world without logarithms

$y = \log _b (x)$, answers the question to what power $y$ do I have to raise a basis $b$ to get $x$. 

Although the action of the logarithm is somewhat cumbersome, this does not prevent the function from appearing in many natural phenomena.  
Loudness, pitch, the strength of earthquakes are all measured in logarithmic scales. 

How would a world without logarithms look like? 

Here we listen to this world exploring the linear piano.
